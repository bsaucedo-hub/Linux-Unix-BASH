# Project Title

Bash Backup and Directory Management Scripts

## Description

This repository contains Bash scripts designed for automating file management tasks on a Linux/Unix system used in my Biol 668 Spring 2025 class. The main script facilitates the backup of files from one directory to a BACKUP_FILES directory in the user's home directory. The scripts also include functionality for organizing data files into designated directories (RAW_DATA, P_DATA, and RESULTS) and making these directories accessible through the system $PATH variable.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Linux or Unix-based operating system

Bash shell (typically pre-installed on most systems)

Basic knowledge of terminal usage

### Installing

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd repository-name
Make the script files executable: chmod +x *.sh

### Executing program

## Help

Missing directory: If a directory doesn't exist when the script runs, it will be created automatically.

Incorrect permissions: Ensure your script files are executable (use chmod +x).
